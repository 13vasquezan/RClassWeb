##Who I Am

I am a 1st year graduate student pursuing my Master's in Experimental Psychology

My overall research interests include memory distortion. However, I am also interested in true verses false memory, stereotypes, and how we use information to fill in gaps in our memory.

This is a web journal to show the coding work and progressin the R class
